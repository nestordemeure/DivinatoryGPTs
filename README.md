# Divinatory GPTs

This repository contains the prompts, and scripts related to various [custom GPTs](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts)[^divin].

Each folder correspond to a GPT (containing a short description, its icon and prompt) except for the `scripts` folder which contains various pieces of code that are used by several models.

Custom GPT can be built quickly and deployed for free, two very strong features.
The point of this repository is to test their usefulness and limits, exploring what can and cannot be done with them.

[^divin]: Most of them having to do with psychic readings. It's a fun topic to play with and let me exercise both code and knowledge sources.
